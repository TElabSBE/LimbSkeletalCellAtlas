# The Limb Skeletal Cell Atlas

## About
Breakthroughs in improving scalability have led to the creation of organism-wide transcriptomic datasets, aiming to comprehensively profile the cell types and states within an organism throughout its lifecycle. To date, however, the skeleton remains a majorly underrepresented organ system in organism-wide atlases. Considering how the skeleton not only serves as the central framework of the vertebrate body but is also the home of the hematopoietic niche and a central player in major metabolic and homeostatic processes, this presents a major deficit in current reference atlas projects. To address this issue, we integrated ten separate scRNA-seq datasets containing limb skeletal cells and their developmental precursors, generating an atlas of 133 332 cells. This limb skeletal cell atlas describes cells across the mesenchymal lineage from the induction of the limb field to the adult bone and encompasses 39 different cell states. 

This repository contains all notebooks required to perform the analyses performed in the manuscript and generate all figures.

## Reproducibility
To avoid conflicts between package dependencies, it is strongly recommended to use our [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/gnasello/sc-env) environment.
